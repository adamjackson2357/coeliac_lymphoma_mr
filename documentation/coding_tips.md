## Useful Info

README.md
- READMEs in the .md (markdown) format will render really nicely on git
- You can find them in each directory
- Please update them (including this one!) as we go!
- I think we have a lecture on markdown later on in TDS

.gitignore 
- Stops git from pushing some files to the remote (bad practice to push sensitive data)
- It's 'hidden' in the terminal, use `ls -a` to see that it's there

Documentation
- Found this standardised documentation for R functions called Roxygen2
- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html

Coding Tips!
- Hopefully these don't come across as patronising! Just a few things I've picked up over the last few years.
- Try to avoid capital letters as much as possible. E.g. in variable names, filenames etc. This will make everything much easier in the long run. This README is an unfortunate contradiction.
- Use '_' instead of spaces in strings.
- A consistent date format is really useful; I'd suggest `YYYYMMDD` as it makes sorting easy. E.g. "20210813", 13th August 2021
